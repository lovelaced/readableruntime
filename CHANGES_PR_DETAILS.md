# PR Details Fix Summary

## Issue
The enhanced SDK mapper was fetching PR details (title, author, etc.) when getting PRs between tags, but these details were not being included in the final mapping output.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced SDK PR Mapper (`enhanced_sdk_pr_mapper.py`)
- Modified `generate_comprehensive_mapping()` to include a `pr_details` dictionary in the output
- PR details from the `fetch_prs_between_tags()` method are now properly stored and included in the final mapping

### 2. Populate SDK Mappings Script (`scripts/populate_sdk_mappings.py`)
- Updated to merge data from both sources:
  - Enhanced mapper (SDK version bumps)
  - Original changelog mapper (explicit PR mentions in CHANGELOG)
- Added `merge_pr_data()` function to combine PR data from both sources
- Modified `generate_individual_pr_files()` to include PR details in individual PR JSON files
- The script now generates a comprehensive mapping that includes:
  - PR details (title, author, labels, merged_at, URL)
  - Runtime releases for each PR
  - Statistics showing data sources

### 3. New Scripts Created

#### `scripts/populate_comprehensive_sdk_mappings.py`
- Standalone script that performs the same comprehensive mapping
- Useful for running the full mapping process independently

#### `scripts/test_pr_search.py`
- Test script to verify PR title search functionality
- Usage: `python scripts/test_pr_search.py <search_term>`
- Searches through PR titles and displays matching results with details

## Output Structure

The main `sdk_pr_mappings.json` now includes:
```json
{
  "last_updated": "...",
  "runtime_sdk_versions": { ... },
  "sdk_version_ranges": { ... },
  "pr_to_releases": {
    "PR_NUMBER": [
      {
        "runtime_version": "1.6.1",
        "sdk_version": "stable2503-2",
        "included_via": "sdk_version_bump|changelog_mention"
      }
    ]
  },
  "pr_details": {
    "PR_NUMBER": {
      "number": "6827",
      "title": "Introduction of Approval Slashes...",
      "merged_at": "2025-06-05T15:23:05Z",
      "labels": ["I1-security", "T8-polkadot"],
      "author": "Overkillus",
      "url": "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6827"
    }
  },
  "statistics": {
    "total_prs_mapped": 1234,
    "prs_from_version_tracking": 1000,
    "prs_from_changelog": 234,
    "prs_in_both": 50,
    "runtime_releases_analyzed": 10
  }
}
```

Individual PR files (`prs/PR_NUMBER.json`) now include:
```json
{
  "pr_number": "6827",
  "pr_details": {
    "number": "6827",
    "title": "Introduction of Approval Slashes...",
    "merged_at": "2025-06-05T15:23:05Z",
    "labels": ["I1-security", "T8-polkadot"],
    "author": "Overkillus",
    "url": "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6827"
  },
  "runtime_releases": [
    {
      "runtime_version": "1.6.1",
      "sdk_version": "stable2503-2",
      "included_via": "sdk_version_bump"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

1. Run the populate script to generate comprehensive mappings:
   ```bash
   python scripts/populate_sdk_mappings.py
   ```

2. Test PR search functionality:
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_pr_search.py "approval slash"
   ```

## Benefits

- PR details are now properly saved for all PRs (both from SDK version bumps and changelog mentions)
- Title search functionality is fully supported
- Data from multiple sources is merged without duplicates
- Individual PR files contain all necessary information for fast lookups
