    "body": "# Changelog\n\nChangelog for the runtimes governed by the Polkadot Fellowship.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).\n\n## [1.3.3] 01.10.2024\n\n### Changed\n\n- Allow signed origins to send arbitrary XCMs from some system chains ([polkadot-fellows/runtimes#407](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/407))\n- Include the Core and Salary pallets into the Fellowship proxy ([polkadot-fellows/runtimes#454](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/454))\n- Add new community democracy and treasuries pallets to Encointer ([polkadot-fellows/runtimes#456](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/456))\n- Change target block time for Encointer to 6s ([polkadot-fellows/runtimes#462](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/462))\n- Asset Hubs: allow Polkadot, Kusama and Ethereum assets across P<>K bridge ([polkadot-fellows/runtimes#421](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/421)).\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Chain-spec generator: propagate the `on_chain_release_build` feature to the chain-spec generator. Without this the live/genesis chain-specs contain a wrongly-configured WASM blob ([polkadot-fellows/runtimes#450](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/450)).\n- Adds a migration to the Polkadot Coretime chain to fix an issue from the initial Coretime migration. ([polkadot-fellows/runtimes#458](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/458))\n- Adds migrations to restore currupted staking ledgers in Polkadot and Kusama ([polkadot-fellows/runtimes#447](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/447))\n\n### Added\n\n- Polkadot: Make the current inflation formula adjustable ([polkadot-fellows/runtimes#443](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/443))\n\n# Runtime info\n*These runtimes were built with **rustc 1.81.0 (eeb90cda1 2024-09-04)** using **[srtool v0.16.0](https://github.com/paritytech/srtool)***\n\nTo replicate the build, use the following command:\n```sh\nsrtool build\n       --root --profile production\n       --package CRATE_NAME --runtime-dir PATH_TO_CRATE\n       --build-opts=\"--features=on-chain-release-build\"\n```\n\n## Polkadot\n~~~\n\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Runtime Size:           1.74Mi (1817620 bytes)\n\ud83d\udddc

      "body": "Note: for more details on the corrupted ledgers issue and recovery steps check https://hackmd.io/m_h9DRutSZaUqCwM9tqZ3g?view.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a migration in Polkadot and Kusama runtimes to recover the current corrupted ledgers in Polkadot and Kusama. A migration consists of:\r\n\r\n1. Call into `pallet_staking::Pallet::<T>::restore_ledger` for each of the \"whitelisted\" stashes as `Root` origin.\r\n2. Performs a check that ensures the restored ledger's stake does not overflow the current stash's free balance. If that's the case, force unstake the ledger. This check is currently missing in polkadot-sdk/pallet-staking ([PR with patch here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5066)).\r\n\r\nThe reason to restore the corrupted ledgers as migrations implemented in the fellowship runtimes is twofold:\r\n\r\n1. The call to `pallet_staking::Pallet::<T>::restore_ledger` and check + `force_unstake` must be done atomically (thus a ledger can't be safely restored with a set of two distinct extrinsic calls, so it's not possible to use referenda to this fx).\r\n2. To speed up the whole process and avoid having to wait for 1. merge and releases of https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5066 and 2. referenda to call into `Call::restore_ledger` for both Polkadot and Kusama.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could add a new temporary pallet directly in the fellowship runtime which would expose an extrinsic to restore the ledgers and perform the extra missing check. See this [PR as an example](https://github.com/gpestana/fellowship-runtimes/pull/2).\r\n\r\n---\r\n- [x] on-runtime-upgrade tests against Polkadot and Kusama\r\n- [x] staking try-state checks passing after all migrations.",
