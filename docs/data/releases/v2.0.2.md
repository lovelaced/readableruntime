# Release v2.0.2 Analysis: Polkadot Fellows Runtimes

## 1. Executive Summary for Non-Technical Users

### Main Improvements
This release primarily focuses on **fixing critical issues with staking rewards** and improving the development infrastructure. The key improvements are:

- **Fixed staking rewards on Asset Hub**: Rewards were running about 60% lower than expected - this has been corrected
- **Improved cross-chain staking**: Fixed issues with staking operations when using cross-chain messaging (XCM)
- **Better security deposits**: Set proper security deposits for validator elections
- **Cleaner development tools**: Removed outdated testing code and improved build processes

### Benefits for Users
- **Stakers will see proper rewards again**: If you're staking on Asset Hub, your rewards should return to expected levels
- **More reliable cross-chain operations**: Staking through cross-chain transactions should work more smoothly
- **Better system stability**: Various under-the-hood fixes improve overall reliability

### Actions Required
- **No immediate action needed** for most users
- **Stakers**: Your rewards should automatically improve once this release is deployed
- **Validators**: No configuration changes required

## 2. Key Changes Explained

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **Staking Inflation Fix**: The staking reward calculation was using incorrect total token supply numbers, resulting in ~60% lower rewards than intended. This has been corrected to match the original Relay Chain configuration.

- **Cross-Chain Staking Fix**: Users trying to stake through cross-chain messages (XCM) were experiencing failures. The system now properly handles these transactions.

### Security Improvements
- **Validator Election Security**: Added proper deposit requirements for invulnerable validators in elections, preventing potential abuse of the election system.

### Performance Improvements
- **Faster Development Builds**: Removed outdated Asset Hub Migration (AHM) checks that were slowing down the development process
- **More Reliable Downloads**: Fixed flaky network downloads in the build system that could cause deployment delays

## 3. Technical Summary for Developers

### Major Changes
- **Staking Configuration**: Moved `experimental_inflation_prediction_info` from relay chain to Asset Hub and updated inflation calculation parameters
- **XCM Configuration**: Enhanced XCM call filtering to properly support staking operations across chains
- **Build System**: Updated to use Parity's SR Tools action v0.9.4 and improved artifact naming for debug builds

### Migration Requirements
- **Runtime Upgrade**: Standard runtime upgrade process applies
- **No Storage Migrations**: This release doesn't require complex storage migrations
- **Validator Configuration**: No changes required for validator setup

### API/Interface Changes
- **Staking Interface**: No breaking changes to public staking APIs
- **XCM Interface**: Expanded support for cross-chain staking calls, but maintains backward compatibility
