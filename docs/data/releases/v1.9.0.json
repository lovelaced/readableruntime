    "body": "# Changelog\n\nChangelog for the runtimes governed by the Polkadot Fellowship.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).\n\n## [1.9.0] 26.09.2025\n\n### Added\n\n- Enable the Asset Hub Migration for Kusama at block `30423691`, projected to be Tuesday 7th Oct 8 AM UTC ([polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/935](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/935))\n- Code for the Asset Hub Migration ([polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/856](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/856))\n\n### Changed\n\n-  Pallet XCM - Disable reserve_asset_transfer for DOT|KSM ([polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/880](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/880))\n  \ud83d\udea8 Pallet XCM's `limited_reserve_transfer_assets` and `reserve_transfer_assets` extrinsics now returns an error when it determines that a reserve transfer of DOT|KSM has to be done.\n  This is a safeguard in preparation for the Asset Hub Migration (AHM), where the reserve of DOT|KSM will change from the Relay Chain to Asset Hub.\n  After the migration, another patch will remove this error case and use the correct reserve.\n  \ud83d\udea8 For DOT|KSM cross-chain transfers please use `transfer_assets_using_type_and_then` or `execute`.\n  Please see this [Polkadot forum post](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/mandatory-action-guide-for-ahm-broken-native-crosschain-transfers/) for more details.\n\n# Runtime info\n*These runtimes were built with **rustc 1.88.0 (6b00bc388 2025-06-23)** using **[srtool v0.18.3](https://github.com/paritytech/srtool)***\n\nTo replicate the build, use the following command:\n```sh\nsrtool build\n       --root --profile production\n       --package CRATE_NAME --runtime-dir PATH_TO_CRATE\n       --build-opts=\"\"\n```\n\n##

  "ai_analysis": "# Polkadot Fellows Runtimes v1.9.0 Release Analysis\n\n## Executive Summary for Non-Technical Users\n\n### What Changed?\nThis release is primarily focused on **Asset Hub Migration (AHM)** - a major infrastructure upgrade that moves important financial functions from the main Polkadot/Kusama chains to specialized Asset Hub parachains.\n\n### Main Benefits:\n- **Better Performance**: Financial operations will be faster and more efficient on specialized chains\n- **Lower Costs**: Transaction fees for asset-related operations will be reduced\n- **Enhanced Security**: New backup systems and safety mechanisms protect against migration issues\n- **Future-Proofing**: Prepares the network for Polkadot 2.0\n\n### What Users Need to Know:\n- **Kusama Migration**: Scheduled for block 30,423,691 (projected Tuesday, Oct 7th, 8 AM UTC)\n- **Temporary Restrictions**: Some cross-chain transfers of DOT/KSM are temporarily disabled as a safety measure\n- **Alternative Methods**: Users can still transfer using `transfer_assets_using_type_and_then` or `execute` functions\n- **Account Migration**: User accounts and balances will be automatically moved to Asset Hub\n- **No Action Required**: The migration happens automatically, but users should be aware of the timing\n\n### Safety Features Added:\n- Emergency multisig system that can pause/cancel migration if needed\n- Multiple signature requirements for critical operations\n- Comprehensive testing and rollback capabilities\n\n## Key Changes Explained\n\n### Breaking Changes\n**Cross-Chain Transfer Restrictions**:\n- `limited_reserve_transfer_assets` and `reserve_transfer_assets` now return errors for DOT/KSM transfers\n- **Why**: Safety measure during the transition period while the reserve location changes from Relay Chain to Asset Hub\n- **Workaround**: Use `transfer_assets_using_type_and_then` for DOT/KSM transfers\n- **Duration**: Temporary - will be restored after migration completes\n\n### Security Improvements\n**Emergency Response System**:\n- New multisig system allows authorized parties to pause or cancel migration\n- Supports multiple signature types (SR25519, ED25519, ECDSA) for broader compatibility\n- Manager accounts with special privileges to handle migration issues\n- Flow control systems prevent network overload during migration\n\n**Migration Safety**:\n- Comprehensive pre/post migration checks for all affected systems\n- Account translation mapping ensures no funds are lost\n- Idempotent migration (can be safely re-run if needed)\n- Cool-off period after migration for verification\n\n### Performance Improvements\n**Message Prioritization**:\n- Asset Hub messages get priority during migration to speed up the process\n- Optimized block processing to handle migration workload\n- Improved weight accounting for better resource management\n\n### New Features\n**Migration Management**:\n- Automated scheduling system for migration timing\n- Real-time monitoring and logging of migration progress\n- Comprehensive testing framework for validation\n- Stage management system for controlled migration phases\n\n## Technical Summary for Developers\n\n### Major API/Interface Changes\n1. **Pallet XCM Updates**:\n   - Updated to version 22.0.1\n   - Reserve transfer functions now reject DOT/KSM transfers\n   - New `transfer_assets_using_type_and_then` recommended for native token transfers\n\n2. **Migration Pallets**:\n   - New `pallet_rc_migrator` for Relay Chain migration logic\n   - New `pallet_ah_migrator` for Asset Hub migration processing\n   - Runtime call filtering during migration stages\n\n3. **Multisig System**:\n   - Enhanced to support MultiSignature types\n   - Unsigned transaction support for emergency operations\n   - New threshold-based authorization system\n\n### Migration Requirements\n**For Chain Operators**:\n- Runtime upgrade to v1.9.0 triggers automatic migration scheduling\n- Monitor migration stages: Scheduled \u2192 Started \u2192 Data Transfer \u2192 Cool-off \u2192 Complete\n- Emergency procedures available through multisig system\n\n**For dApp Developers**:\n- Update XCM transfer logic to use new recommended methods\n- Account for temporary restrictions on reserve transfers\n- Test against new Asset Hub endpoints for asset operations\n- Update account translation logic if directly handling account IDs\n\n### Technical Improvements\n**Runtime Architecture**:\n- Separated migration logic into modular components\n- Improved error handling and logging throughout migration process\n- Enhanced weight calculations for migration operations\n- Better resource management during high-load periods\n\n**Data Integrity**:\n- Comprehensive storage migration for all affected pallets\n- Account reference counting preservation\n- Hold/freeze reason translation between chains\n- Total issuance tracking across chain boundaries\n\n## Code Impact Analysis\n\n### Most Affected Systems\n1. **Migration Infrastructure** (New): Complete new pallet system for managing the migration\n2. **XCM/Cross-Chain** (Major): Updated transfer mechanisms and restrictions\n3. **Account Management** (Major): New translation and migration systems\n4. **Governance Systems** (Moderate): Migration of treasury, referenda, and voting systems\n5. **Staking/Nomination** (Moderate): Migration to async staking system\n\n### Types of Changes\n**New Features (60%)**:\n- Complete Asset Hub Migration system\n- Emergency multisig controls\n- Migration monitoring and management tools\n\n**Safety Improvements (25%)**:\n- Temporary restrictions on potentially problematic operations\n- Enhanced error handling and validation\n- Comprehensive testing frameworks\n\n**Bug Fixes/Improvements (15%)**:\n- Runtime matrix corrections\n- Dependency updates\n- Performance optimizations\n\n### Development Process\n- Extensive integration testing with real chain snapshots\n- Staged rollout approach with safety mechanisms\n- Comprehensive documentation and user guides\n- Multiple review cycles with security focus\n\nThis release represents one of the most significant infrastructure upgrades in Polkadot/Kusama history, with careful attention to user safety and system reliability throughout the migration process.",

      "author": "ggwpez",
      "merged_at": "2025-09-24T23:22:26Z",
      "body": "A high-level look of the migration is this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1204\" height=\"745\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-17 at 18 23 57\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fb39ef8-5efa-4db2-81db-6dd775af3a39\" />\r\n\r\nYou can see the main components being the `pallet_rc_migrator` and `pallet_ah_migrator`. The RC migrator pallet takes data out of the RC storage and enqueues it for AH through XCM::Transact calls to the AH migrator pallet.  \r\nEach pallet on the RC side has a migrator module that handles the removal of the old data and creation of the messages for AH. AH then processes these messages through the MQ pallet and acknowledges back to RC that they were processed (not shown in the graphic).\r\n\r\nThere is rate-limiting code in place to prevent it from overloading the DMP queue or Asset Hub.\r\n\r\n## For Reviewers\r\n\r\nThe review comments are being addressed in https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/915.  \r\nWe need eyes on the Core part that is described below.\r\n\r\n## Core STM\r\n\r\nThe main stage transitions look like this. The only manual part is the scheduling call by the fellowship that kicks off the procedure:\r\n\r\n* `Pending` wait for Fellowship to call `schedule_migration(when)` -> Scheduled\r\n* `Scheduled` waiting for scheduled block -> `WaitingForAH`\r\n* `WaitingForAH` AH replies that it is ready -> `WarmUp`\r\n* `WarmUp`  waiting for warm-up end -> `Starting`\r\n* `Starting` doing some startup initialization -> `DataMigration`\r\n* `DataMigration` MAIN PART **all pallet migrations finish** -> `CoolOff`\r\n* `CoolOff` waiting for cool-off to end -> `SignalMigrationFinish`\r\n* `SignalMigrationFinish` send signal to AH that we are done -> `MigrationDone`\r\n* `MigrationDone` finished, unlock all Pallets.\r\n\r\n### State Machine\r\n\r\nThe core State Machine lives in the `RcMigrator` pallet in its `on_initialize`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/blob/8ef1cc739d756b109dc93eaf3b9da00e3dcf1383/pallets/rc-migrator/src/lib.rs#L1338-L1342\r\n\r\nOn each block the Rc Migrator checks the current state and possibly progresses to the next one. It will only do a single state transition per block to reduce complexity of the code. Generally, there are three states per pallet (called [*stages*](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/blob/8ef1cc739d756b109dc93eaf3b9da00e3dcf1383/pallets/rc-migrator/src/lib.rs#L190-L389)  in the code). Some pallets have more then three, but it is generally still a multiple of three and always follows the pattern of `PalletInit`, `PalletOngoing { cursor\u00a0}`, `PalletDone`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/blob/8ef1cc739d756b109dc93eaf3b9da00e3dcf1383/pallets/rc-migrator/src/lib.rs#L239-L244\r\n\r\nEach pallet then has one migrator struct (eg. `MultisigMigrator<T>`) that migrates the storage items from the Relay side. It lives in the module of its name `rc-migrator/src/multisig.rs` respectively.  \r\nTaking Multisigs as an example; you can find two functions in the migrator struct: `migrate_many` and `migrate_single`. The former one is from the [`PalletMigration` trait](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/blob/715dbb4455a127066d0118ce7a096c72200e1126/pallets/rc-migrator/src/types.rs#L209-L221). The `migrate_single` function is done by convention to keep the code readable. The `migrate_many` does the following:  \r\n- Weight accounting for the RC side: Normal weight tracking to not have overtime RC blocks\r\n- Weight accounting for the AH side: Ensuring to not send messages that would take up too much weight on AH processing\r\n- Ensure that DMP messages are sensibly sized by using the `XcmBatchAndMeter`\r\n- Taking the data out from the Relay chain (deleting it)\r\n- Including the data into a DMP message and sending it towards AH\r\n\r\n### AH Side\r\n\r\nThe main logic on Asset Hub lives in the `AhMigrator` pallet. It contains at least one extrinsic per pallet to receive the incoming data from the RC. We are using extrinsics since RC is wrapping the data into XCM::Transacts:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/blob/9a20b12e22b019c1c0b15b9af897567a559e424c/pallets/ah-migrator/src/lib.rs#L650-L653\r\n\r\nThis calls into the [`multisig` module](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/blob/6b603ca47e5c49b3a898be3f8f6b078c424f42a0/pallets/ah-migrator/src/multisig.rs#L37) to integrate the data into the storage. Per convention we are emitting events for each item and the whole batch.  \r\nThe main task of the AH side is to integrate the data. In the example of the multisig it is special since we do not migrate the multisig, but only the reserved account which will be unreserved on AH.\r\n\r\n## Messaging Logic\r\n\r\nThe messaging is ACK based. The Relay sends message to Asset Hub up to a specified limit (50). The limit can be adjusted on the fly through a dedicated dispatchable call, restricted to Admin and Manager roles. The limit may be overstepped by the configured batch-size (10), so in total there should never be more than 60 DMPs queued. Each DMP is set to at most [50KB](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/blob/8ef1cc739d756b109dc93eaf3b9da00e3dcf1383/pallets/rc-migrator/src/lib.rs#L131). \r\n\r\nThe Relay Chain migrator creates a query for each XCM data message using the XCM query\u2013response primitives and attaches a response status request from Asset Hub to the message. The XCM executor on Asset Hub then sends back the response status for every message with such a request. \r\n\r\nThe Relay migrator stores each data message sent to Asset Hub until it receives confirmation of successful processing. It also provides a dispatchable call, available only to Admin and Manager roles, to resend any unconfirmed messages.\r\n\r\nA bug that prevented certain messages from being accounted for during a particulat pallet migration caused the Westend AHM stall. The system was queuing too many DMPs, which forced WAH to author an overweight block while attempting to process them all at once.\r\n\r\n## Call Filtering\r\n\r\nPallet calls are filtered during the migration for three reasons:\r\n- prevent malicious users from spamming the chain with cheap TX and slowing down the migration\r\n- prevent users from sending many UMPs out of AH to clog up the UMP queue\r\n- prevent interference with pallets that are being migrated to avoid messing up their storage invariants\r\n\r\nBoth RC and AH provide call filters for `Before`, `During` and `After` the migration. As you can see, most things are disabled during the migration on both chains. After the migration, Relay chain keeps pretty much everything disabled since it was now enabled on AH:\r\n- Before: RC everything enabled, AH all new pallets disabled (staking, gov etc)\r\n- During: RC mostly everything disabled, AH mostly everything disabled\r\n- After: RC mostly everything disabled (staking, gov etc), AH everything enabled (staking, gov etc)\r\n\r\nThis is implemented  by returning three bools, one for each phase:  \r\nhttps://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/blob/88f4aaf62236fbee9cfb9183e44333bac45b1371/system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/ah_migration/call_filter.rs#L81-L83\r\n\r\n## Testing and Dry-Runs\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/paritytech/ahm-dryrun is the repository for testing infrastructure for AHM. As of now, the following is being tested there (as a part of \"[AHM Flow (all steps)](https://github.com/paritytech/ahm-dryrun/actions/workflows/zombie-bite.yml)\" nightly action):\r\n* Dry-running a migration on a fork of Kusama\r\n* Re-running the rust unit tests introduced in this branch\r\n* Re-running a subset of the same tests, re-written in TS\r\n* Re-running PET tests.\r\n\r\nEach action produces a table with the summary of the test results: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"682\" height=\"357\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-19 at 09 03 20\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69c1e37d-6f8f-4b57-b97f-75781a1e1a3a\" />\r\n\r\nAnd 4 snapshot files (2 real databases, 2 try-runtime snapshots) which can be used to re-run any of the tests, or run the pre/post migration chain, locally. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1347\" height=\"476\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-19 at 09 03 40\"
