# Polkadot Fellows Runtimes v2.0.0 Release Analysis

## 1. Executive Summary for Non-Technical Users

### Main Improvements
This release focuses on three key areas:
- **Enhanced Developer Tools**: Added new "view functions" capability across all system chains, making it easier for developers to query blockchain data
- **Major Migration Preparation**: Extensive preparations for an important Polkadot network upgrade called "AHM" (Async Handling Migration)
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved issues from the previous version

### Benefits for Users
- **Better Developer Experience**: Developers can now use improved tools to interact with system chains (Asset Hub, Bridge Hub, etc.)
- **Network Stability**: The migration preparations ensure smoother future upgrades
- **Reliability**: Bug fixes improve overall system stability

### Actions Required
- **No immediate action needed** for regular users
- Developers may want to explore the new view functions capability
- Network operators should be aware of the upcoming migration preparations

## 2. Key Changes Explained

### New Features
**View Functions Support**: 
- What it does: Allows developers to call special "read-only" functions on system chains without making transactions
- Why it matters: Faster and cheaper way to query blockchain data
- Impact: Improved developer tools and better user experiences in wallets and dApps

### Breaking Changes
**None identified** - This appears to be primarily additive changes and internal improvements.

### Security Improvements
- Migration code includes extensive validation and checking mechanisms
- Improved error handling in migration processes

### Performance Improvements
- View functions provide more efficient data querying
- Streamlined migration processes for better network performance during upgrades

## 3. Technical Summary for Developers

### Major API Changes
- **New Runtime API**: `execute_view_function()` added to all system chain runtimes
  - Kusama relay chain
  - Polkadot relay chain  
  - Asset Hubs (Kusama & Polkadot)
  - Bridge Hubs
  - People chains
  - Coretime chains

### Migration Requirements
- **No breaking changes** for existing integrations
- New view functions API is additive - existing code continues to work
- Migration preparations are internal and don't affect external APIs

### Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced Testing Infrastructure**: Updated snapshots and test configurations for AHM migration
- **Weight Recalculations**: New benchmark weights for election provider and staking async operations
- **Migration Logic**: Comprehensive staking, delegation, and proxy migration capabilities

## 4. Code Impact Analysis

### Most Affected System Components
1. **Runtime APIs** (14 files): Addition of view functions across all system chains
2. **Migration Infrastructure** (55 files): Extensive AHM preparation work including:
   - Staking system migrations
   - Delegation handling
   - Proxy migrations
   - Nomination pool transitions

### Types of Changes Made
- **75% New Features**: View functions implementation and migration capabilities
- **20% Infrastructure**: Testing improvements, weight updates, CI/CD enhancements  
- **5% Bug Fixes**: Version bumps and minor corrections

### Development Areas
- **Runtime Development**: Major focus on runtime API expansion
- **Migration Engineering**: Sophisticated state transition logic
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Enhanced test coverage and validation
- **DevOps**: Improved CI/CD pipeline configurations

### Change Complexity
- **High**: The AHM migration work represents significant complexity with 1,721 additions across 55 files
- **Low**: View functions implementation was straightforward, adding consistent patterns across chains
- **Medium**: Infrastructure and testing improvements required moderate complexity changes

This release represents a significant step forward in both developer experience and network upgrade capabilities, with careful attention to maintaining backward compatibility while adding powerful new features.
