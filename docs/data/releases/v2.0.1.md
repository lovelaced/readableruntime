# Polkadot Fellows Runtimes v2.0.1 Release Analysis

## 1. Executive Summary for Non-Technical Users

### Main Improvements
This is a **maintenance release** focused on internal improvements and cleanup. The changes primarily affect the development and testing infrastructure rather than end-user functionality.

**Key improvements:**
- **Faster development process**: Removed outdated testing procedures that were slowing down software updates
- **Better infrastructure**: Improved the automated systems that build and test the software
- **Version alignment**: Updated all runtime versions to properly reflect the 2.0 release

### Benefits for Users
- **Faster updates**: Future releases will come out more quickly due to streamlined testing
- **More reliable software**: Improved development infrastructure leads to better quality control
- **No disruption**: These are behind-the-scenes improvements that don't require any user action

### Actions Required
**None** - This is a maintenance release that doesn't require any action from users, validators, or dApp developers.

## 2. Key Changes Explained

### Performance Improvements
- **Faster CI/CD Pipeline**: Removed Asset Hub Migration (AHM) tests that were no longer needed, significantly speeding up the development and release process
- **Optimized Infrastructure**: All development jobs now run on dedicated self-hosted machines, providing more consistent and faster build times

### Maintenance & Cleanup
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed over 6,600 lines of outdated test code related to Asset Hub Migration
- **Dependency Updates**: Updated various software dependencies to their latest versions
- **Version Standardization**: All runtime spec versions updated to 2.0 (version 2_000_000)

### No Breaking Changes
This release contains no breaking changes - all existing functionality remains the same.

### No Security Changes

### Most Affected Systems
1. **CI/CD Infrastructure** (14 files changed): Complete migration to self-hosted runners
2. **Integration Tests** (Major cleanup): Removal of entire AHM test suite
3. **Runtime Specifications** (13 files): Version number updates across all runtimes

### Types of Changes
- **Infrastructure Refactoring (70%)**: GitHub Actions workflow updates and CI improvements
- **Code Cleanup (25%)**: Removal of obsolete test code and dependencies
- **Version Management (5%)**: Spec version bumps for proper release tracking

### Change Scope
- **High Impact on Development**: Significantly improved CI/CD pipeline efficiency
